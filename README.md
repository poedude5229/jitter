# Firefly

Firefly is my technical demonstration of fullstack development, currently a work in progress.
Done in my free time, between my current full time job, personal life and search for a software development career, this
project is a conglomeration of my favorite aspects of Instagram, Twitter and Tumblr. Users will be able to explore others' posts and profiles
